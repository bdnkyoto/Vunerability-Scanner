# Automated Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

This project implements a Python-based vulnerability scanner to automatically detect common web application vulnerabilities. It includes modules for identifying XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, IDOR, Open Redirect, Directory Traversal, and Command Injection vulnerabilities. The scanner is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new vulnerability checks.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to automate the process of web application security testing, enabling developers and security professionals to quickly identify and address vulnerabilities. By automating vulnerability scanning, it helps to improve the overall security posture of web applications and reduce the risk of security breaches.

## Features

* Vulnerability Detection:
    * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Reflected and Stored
    * SQL Injection
    * Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    * Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
    * Open Redirect
    * Directory Traversal
    * Command Injection
* Modular Design: Easy to add new vulnerability modules.
* Configurable Scan Targets: Ability to specify target URLs and parameters.
* Detailed Reporting: Generates reports in various formats (e.g., HTML, JSON).

## Technology Stack

* Python 3.x
* requests
* urllib.parse

## Setup and Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <your_repository_url>`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd vulnerability_scanner`
3.  (Recommended) Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
4.  Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
